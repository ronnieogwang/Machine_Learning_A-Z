<h1>CAP - Cummulative accuracy Pofile</h1>
<p>It is a curve used to evaluate the perfomance of different models</p>
<p>It is illustrated int the image in this very folder.</p>

Cap analysis;
<p>The closer your model to the gray lin(perfect line), the better your model and 
the closer to blue line (random line), the worse your model.</p>

<h2>Accuracy Ration</h2>
Accuracy ratio = area under model curve/area under perfect curve
0<ar<1
The closer to 1, the better the model

<h3>Evaluating accuracy curve, intuitively</h3>
<p>at 50% of your independent variable, obtain the dependent variable X </p>
